# Lost platformer

## Repo setup notes
1. Clone/Pull the repo down from your github
2. Get/update SFML by running: git submodule update --init --recursive
3. Run CMake to generate your build folder (see this link: https://github.com/edinburgh-napier/aux_guides/blob/master/cmake_guide.pdf)
    *remember to put the build folder outside of the repo folder*
